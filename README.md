# Hang In There

### Abstract:
1. The page displays a random poster on the page load and also displays a newly created random poster when the "Make Random Poster" button is clicked.
2. The button clicks allow the user to toggle between sections
3. The create a poster form allows a user to submit their own data (image url, quote, and title) then display a custom poster on the main section when the "Create My Poster" button is clicked. The submitted data is stored for later use in randomly generated posters.
4. Allows users to save posters and view them in the "Saved Posters" section.
5. Allows users to delete saved posters with a double click (this deletion also removes the saved poster from the SavedPoster array).
6. NOTE: user must double click the border of the poster they wish to remove
