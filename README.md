# Hang In There

### Abstract:
- The page displays a random poster on the page load and also displays a newly created random poster when the "Make Random Poster" button is clicked.
- The button clicks allow the user to toggle between sections
- The create a poster form allows a user to submit their own data (image url, quote, and title) then display a custom poster on the main section when the "Create My Poster" button is clicked. The submitted data is stored for later use in randomly generated posters.
- Allows users to save posters and view them in the "Saved Posters" section.
- Allows users to delete saved posters with a double click [this deletion also removes the saved poster from the SavedPoster array].
- NOTE: user must double click the border of the poster they wish to remove

### Learning Goals:
- Develop research and problem solving skills
- Establish collaborative workflow habits
- Practice managing html elements with javascript
- Tech used: VSCode Text Editor, Github, Chrome DevTools, & Terminal

### Wins + Challenges:
- Successful invokations of complex functions always felt like really big wins (even when smaller components or statemnts of the function operated according to plan)
- Pseudocode use being helpful in keeping work on track
- Great collaborative effort and use of contributors' respective strengths
- Challenges: workflow complications & researching then using new/unfamiliar methods
